# Write a Python script that uses NumPy to create a 1D array and a 2D array (matrix).
 
# The 1D array should contain all even integers from 1 to 9 in ascending order.
# The matrix should have 2 rows with the following values:
# Row 1: 0, 1, 0
# Row 2: 1, 0, 1  
 
# Finally, print the result in the following format:
# First, print the text "1D Array:" on one line, followed by the 1D array on the next line.
# Then, print an empty line ("\n") to separate the outputs.
# After the empty line, print the text "2D Matrix:" followed by the matrix on the next line
import numpy as np

# 1D array of all even integers
arr_1d = np._______

# 2D matrix 2x3
arr_2d = ________

# Print the array and matrix
print("1D Array:")
print(arr_1d)

print("\n2D Matrix:")
print(arr_2d)
